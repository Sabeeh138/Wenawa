# 🎙️ Speech-to-Text AI (AssemblyAI Integration)

This project implements the **Speech-to-Text** component of a **Speech-to-Speech AI model**.  
It uses the **AssemblyAI API** to transcribe audio files into text, forming the first stage of a voice-based conversational system that will later integrate with **Groq** for generating intelligent responses.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🎧 Converts audio speech into text using AssemblyAI  
- 🔐 Secure API key storage with `.env`  
- ⏱️ Real-time polling to track transcription progress  
- 🧠 Structured for easy integration with next AI stages (Groq + TTS)  
- 🧾 Clean modular Python code ready for production  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- 🔁 Integrate transcription output with Groq API for AI text responses

- 🗣️ Add Text-to-Speech (TTS) to convert Groq responses back to audio

- 🌐 Develop a frontend UI (Chainlit or React) for real-time interaction
