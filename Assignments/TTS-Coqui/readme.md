# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS) Generator

This project converts written text into realistic human-like speech using the **Coqui TTS** library. It’s a simple yet powerful Python-based tool that demonstrates how deep learning models can synthesize natural-sounding audio.

## 🚀 Features
- Converts any input text into speech  
- Uses a pretrained **Tacotron2-DDC** model from **Coqui TTS**  
- Saves generated audio as a `.wav` file  
- Automatically plays the generated sound  
- Lightweight, fast, and runs locally

---

## 🧩 Requirements
