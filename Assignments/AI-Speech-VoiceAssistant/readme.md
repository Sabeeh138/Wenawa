# 🎙️ Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI Assistant

This project is a **voice-based conversational AI agent** that listens to your speech, understands it using AI, generates intelligent responses using **Groq LLM**, and speaks them back using **Text-to-Speech** — all in real time.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The system combines:
- 🗣️ **Speech-to-Text (STT)** — using [AssemblyAI API](https://www.assemblyai.com/)
- 🤖 **LLM Conversation** — using [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/)
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** — using [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)

It’s structured to be modular and easily extendable — you can swap out any component (STT, LLM, or TTS) with another provider if needed.
